## Problem 2

```{r }
df_homicides =
  read_csv("homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state),
    resolution = case_when (
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
    )) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "TulsaAL") %>% 
  relocate(city_state) 
```
This data contains information about homicides in 50 large U.S. cities. It includes 52178 observations for the following variables: city_state, uid, reported_date, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex, city, state, lat, lon, disposition, resolution

Next, focusing on Baltimore, MD (using prop.test), the proportion of homicides that are unresolved is 0.645, with a 95% confidence interval of (0.63, 0.66)

```{r }
baltimore_df =
  df_homicides %>% 
  filter(city_state == "BaltimoreMD")

baltimore_summary =
  baltimore_df %>% 
  summarize(
    unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"), 
    n = n()
  )

baltimore_test = 
  prop.test(
  x= baltimore_summary %>% pull(unsolved),
  n=baltimore_summary %>%  pull(n)
)

baltimore_test %>% 
  broom::tidy()
````

To iterate this estimation to all cities in the dataset, we write a function.

```{r }
prop_test_function = function (city_df) {

  city_df =
  df_homicides %>% 
  summarize(
    unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"), 
    n = n()
    )

  city_test = 
  prop.test(
  x = city_df %>% pull(unsolved),
  n = city_df %>%  pull(n))

return(city_test)

}


df_homicides %>% 
filter(city_state == "AlbuquerueNM") %>% 
prop_test_function()
````

Now let’s iterate across all cities

```{r }
results_df <- df_homicides %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarise(
    unsolved= sum(resolution =="unsolved"),
    n = n()
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    test_results = map2(unsolved, n, prop.test),
    tidy_results = map(test_results, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, tidy_results) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_results) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, starts_with("conf"))
````

plot showing estimates and confidence intervals

```{r }
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin =conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust=0.5, hjust=1))
````


##Problem 2

Importing the data

```{r }
problem2 = tibble (
  files = list.files("./data/")
  )

read_data <- function(file_name) {
  
  read_csv(paste0("./data/", file_name))
  
}

study_data = 
  problem2 %>% 
  mutate(
    individual_data = map(files, read_data))
````


Now, let´s tidy the data - ; manipulate file names to include control arm and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other tidying that’s necessary


```{r }
study_data_clean = 
  study_data %>% 
  unnest(individual_data) %>% 
  separate(files, into = c("study_group", "subject_id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = obs, "week_1":"week_8") %>% 
  mutate(
    subject_id = str_replace(subject_id, "\\.csv", ""),
    study_group = recode(study_group, con = "Control", exp = "Experimental"),
    week = str_replace(week, "week_", "")) 
study_data_clean
````

Spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between group

```{r }
study_data_clean %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = obs, color = subject_id, group = subject_id)) + 
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~study_group) +
  labs(
    title = "Observations during 8 weeks", 
    x = "Week", 
    y = "Observation", 
    color = "Participant")
````

From the plot we can see that the observations during the 8 weeks were higher for the experimental group


##Problem 3



```{r }
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = 
  iris %>% map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))

problem3 <- vector("list", length = ncol(iris_with_missing))


na_rep <- function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x)) {
    replace_na(x, mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
    
  }  else if (is.character(x)) {
    replace_na(x, "virginica")
  }
}


finaldata <- map_df(iris_with_missing, na_rep)
````
